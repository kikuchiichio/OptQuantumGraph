# OptQuantumGraph
Computer programs used in "Optimization of quantum graphs using heuristic algorithms (Ichio Kikuchi, Akihito Kikuchi,March, 2021)"

These programs are made for following computations. They require Lapack and Blas libraries.

Protptype.c : Computation of determinant of the energy spectrum of the star-shaped gprah.
ppp.c : Optimization on nodes of the star-shaped gprah.
pppp.c : Optimization on edges of the star-shaped graph. 
ga.c : a discrete proglem concernng the edge connection.

March 5th, 2021: Currently these programs are not written clearly. We are now ameliorating the contents. 
If you need them urgently, please send e-mails to the corresponding author (Akihito Kikuchi) of the article.
