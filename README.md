# OptQuantumGraph
Computer programs used in "Optimization of quantum graphs using heuristic algorithms (Ichio Kikuchi, Akihito Kikuchi,March, 2021)"

These programs are made for following computations which are explained in the article. 

They require Lapack and Blas libraries.

Protptype.c : Computation of the determinant to obtain the energy spectrum of the star-shaped graph.

ppp.c : Optimization on nodes of the star-shaped graph.

pppp.c : Optimization on edges of the star-shaped graph. 

ga.c : a discrete problem concerning the edge-connection.

March 5th, 2021, these programs are not written clearly. We are now ameliorating the contents. 
If you need them urgently, please send e-mails to the corresponding author (Akihito Kikuchi) of the article.
